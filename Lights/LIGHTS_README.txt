Hello! I see you have found the lights for FRC team 3647, the Millennium Falcons!
Not going to lie, I am not a programmer, and I don't really know how to use github,
but we'll see if we can make this work!

You'll see the other .ino file that has "outdated" in its name. Basically, don't use
this file. I should probably remove it, but oh well.

Keep all the files in the same folder, and open one up. That should open the entire code.
The files are arranged in tabs at the top of the IDE. My hope is that the more intuitive 
layout will help encourage other teams to use LEDs on their robot, specifically with
custom programming.

Have fun, and don't hesitate to provide lighting suggestions!
